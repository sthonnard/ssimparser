\arguments{
\item{ssim_file}{Path to the SSIM file or character vector containing the content to load.}

\item{nested_df}{Nest SSIM type 3 into type 2 (TRUE/FALSE). Default to FALSE.}

\item{collist}{List of columns that need to be present in the final Data Frame. get_ssim_collist() to get the full list.}

\item{clean_col_names}{Clean column names in the final Data Frame by removing type2/type3 prefixes (TRUE/FALSE). Default TRUE.}

\item{unpivot_days_of_op}{Unpivot the schedules by creating a schedule by day of operation (TRUE/FALSE). Default FALSE.}

\item{expand_sched}{Expand schedules into flights.}
}
\value{
Data Frame (nested or not) containing the schedules (or flights when schedules were expanded).
}
\description{
Load SSIM file into a Data Frame.
